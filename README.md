# Log:
Today I started messing around with Terrain3D which is excellent for creating the game's huge map, it has chunking too. I also came up with the idea of using faction symbols as a loading screen icon which look really cool. Tomorrow i'll work on one of the Enemy models and continue doing concept art and the terrain addon.
